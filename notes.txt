Lisp: Family of programming languages whose computation is represented by lists.

Author designed it for minimalism, simplicity and clarity

C strings are represented by pointer type char*, stored as a list of characters.

end of strings contain \0 flag so all strings length are length + 1.

Interactive prompt: program that prompts the user for some input and replies back with a message.(REPL)

REPL: Read Evaluate Print Loop.

#include <editline/readline.h> : read input from some prompt while allowing editing of the input
#include <editline/history.h> : records the history of inputs so they can be retrieved by using arrow keys
these are used in lisp for using arrow keys for UNIX systems.
